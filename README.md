## Problem Statement
Many pet owners struggle to find suitable homes for their pets when they are no longer able to care for them due to various reasons such as moving to a new location, financial difficulties, or changes in lifestyle. This often leads to pets being abandoned or surrendered to overcrowded animal shelters, where they may face uncertain futures or even euthanasia due to limited resources and space.
Many pets are sold for the people who don't want to buy them and these pets end up treated badly.


## Solution 
To address this issue, this platform provides a user-friendly interface where pet owners can create detailed profiles for their pets, including photos, descriptions, and relevant information such as age, breed, temperament, and health status. The user who wants to adopt a pet can easily communicate with a seller and make a deal to buy it.

## Description
The pet adoption website project aims to create an online platform that facilitates the adoption, buying, and selling of pets. This website will serve as a centralised marketplace where pet owners can connect with potential adopters or buyers, providing a seamless experience for finding and rehoming pets in need of loving homes.

## Features
Create a User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and visually appealing website interface that is easy to navigate for both pet owners and potential adopters/buyers.

Implement Pet Listing Features: Develop functionalities for pet owners to create detailed profiles for their pets, including photos, descriptions, and relevant information such as breed, age, temperament, and health status.

Enable Search and Filter Options: Implement search and filter options to allow users to find pets based on specific criteria such as species, breed, age, size, location, and adoption status.

Ensure Seller Verification: Establish a verification process for pet sellers to ensure the legitimacy and trustworthiness of listings, providing users with peace of mind when browsing and interacting with listings.

Incorporate Adoption Process Guidance: Provide guidance and resources on the pet adoption process, including information on adoption requirements, fees, and how to schedule meet-and-greet sessions with pets.

Promote Community Engagement: Create a community space where users can interact with each other, share stories, ask questions, and provide advice on pet care and adoption.
